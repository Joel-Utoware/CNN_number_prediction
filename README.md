## What is a convolutional neural network?
A convolutional neural network is a type of machine learning model that is often used in image recognition.
## What data was used in this project?
* The model was created using a Modified National Institute of Standards (MNIST) dataset containing images with numbers 0 to 9 written on them
* Additionally the Windows application called Paint was used to create 3 additional images to show the model working correctly
## How was this project completed?
* The training and testing MNIST datasets were downloaded and preprocessed to be used in the model
* Using PyTorch, a CNN model was made
* The model was then trained and evaluated over 10 epochs and the best model was saved
* The best model was then used to classify the three images made in Paint
